# Hand Gesture Recognition Project

## Description

This project involves building a piece of software that can recognize gestures from a camera video and then carry out certain tasks based on the gesture. This will require computer vision and potentially machine learning techniques.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Tools:** OpenCV (for video processing), MediaPipe (for hand tracking), machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) for gesture classification.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Capturing video from webcam.
*   [ ] Detecting hands in the video stream.
*   [ ] Extracting hand landmarks/features.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Classifying simple gestures (e.g., open hand, closed fist).
*   [ ] (Bonus) Performing actions based on recognized gestures.
