# Directory Tree Generator

This project generates a tree-like structure of a given directory in the command-line interface.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python directory_tree_generator.py
    ```
2.  Enter the path to the directory you want to visualize. Type 'q' to quit.

## Features

-   **Directory Traversal:** Recursively lists files and subdirectories.
-   **Tree Visualization:** Renders the directory structure using ASCII characters for clear visual representation.
-   **Error Handling:** Notifies the user if the provided path does not exist.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. More advanced features like filtering by file type, displaying file sizes, or a graphical interface could be added.
