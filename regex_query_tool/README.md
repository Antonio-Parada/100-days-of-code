# Regex Query Tool

This project implements a basic command-line tool for searching text using regular expressions.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python regex_query_tool.py
    ```
2.  Enter a regex pattern and then the text you want to search within. The tool will display all matches, including line numbers and positions.

## Features

-   **Regex Matching:** Supports standard regular expression syntax.
-   **Line-by-Line Analysis:** Identifies matches within each line of the input text.
-   **Detailed Output:** Provides line number, start/end index, and the matched text for each occurrence.
-   **Case-Insensitive Search:** Performs case-insensitive matching by default.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. More advanced features like regex groups, replace functionality, or a graphical interface could be added.
