# Music Suggestor Project

## Description

This project involves building an AI to suggest music based on a user's taste. Instead of copying existing recommenders, the goal is to try and come up with a custom algorithm and test it out.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Tools:** Machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas), music metadata APIs (e.g., Spotify API, Last.fm API).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Defining a simple representation of user music preferences (e.g., liked genres, artists).
*   [ ] Implementing a basic recommendation algorithm (e.g., content-based filtering).
*   [ ] Suggesting new music based on the algorithm.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Integrating with a music API to fetch real music data.
*   [ ] (Bonus) User feedback mechanism to refine recommendations.
