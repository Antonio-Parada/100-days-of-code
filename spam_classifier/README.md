# Spam Classifier Project

## Description

This project involves building a spam classifier that filters unwanted emails or messages. This will require using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to distinguish between legitimate and spam content.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Tools:** Scikit-learn (for machine learning models), NLTK (for text preprocessing), Pandas (for data handling).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Data collection (e.g., sample spam and ham messages).
*   [ ] Text preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, stop word removal).
*   [ ] Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF).
*   [ ] Training a classification model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
*   [ ] Evaluating model performance.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Simple command-line interface for classifying new messages.
