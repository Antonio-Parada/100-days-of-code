# UML Diagram Generator Project

## Description

This project involves writing a script that goes through object-oriented programming (OOP) code and creates a well-formatted UML diagram for it. This will require parsing code and representing class structures and relationships.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for code parsing and diagram generation)
*   **Tools:** `ast` module (Python for parsing Python code), `Graphviz` (for diagram rendering), `pygraphviz` or `graphviz` Python bindings.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Parsing a simple class definition from code.
*   [ ] Extracting class name, attributes, and methods.
*   [ ] Representing class relationships (e.g., inheritance).
*   [ ] Generating a basic textual representation of a UML class diagram.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Integrating with Graphviz to generate visual diagrams.
