# Pong AI Project

## Description

This project involves adding an AI opponent to the Pong game. The AI should be able to play against a human player or another AI, demonstrating basic game AI principles.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Tools:** Pygame (for game development), simple AI algorithms (e.g., rule-based, basic prediction), or machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym for more advanced AI).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure (building upon the Pong game).
*   [ ] Implementing a simple rule-based AI for the opponent paddle.
*   [ ] Making the AI track the ball's vertical position.
*   [ ] Adjusting AI paddle speed based on ball speed.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing a more advanced AI (e.g., basic prediction of ball trajectory).
