# Antivirus Software Project

## Description

This project involves building an antivirus software that will protect users from viruses and other computer worms. The software should be able to scan files for malicious patterns and notify the user of threats.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for scripting and file system interaction), C++ (for performance-critical scanning)
*   **Tools:** File system access, hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA256), signature databases (for known malware).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Functionality to scan a file or directory.
*   [ ] Basic signature-based detection (checking file hashes against a known malware database).
*   [ ] Notifying the user of detected threats.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Heuristic analysis (detecting suspicious behavior).
*   [ ] (Bonus) Quarantine or deletion of malicious files.
