# Programming Language Project

## Description

This project involves coding a programming language from scratch. This will provide great insights into why languages are structured the way they are and which languages suit which tasks better. The goal is to incorporate some unique features to make the language stand out.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for interpreter/compiler), C/C++ (for performance-critical parts)
*   **Tools:** Lexer/parser generators (e.g., `ply` for Python, `flex`/`bison` for C/C++), Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), virtual machines.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Defining a simple language syntax (grammar).
*   [ ] Implementing a basic lexer (tokenizer).
*   [ ] Implementing a basic parser to build an AST.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing a simple interpreter to execute code.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Adding unique language features.
