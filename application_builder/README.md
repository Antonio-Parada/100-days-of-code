# Application Builder Project

## Description

This is a challenging project that involves designing a system that takes text input and generates applications or at least application interfaces based on the text description. It could also incorporate a drag-and-drop feature for users to build apps.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for backend logic and potentially GUI generation), JavaScript (for web-based drag-and-drop interfaces)
*   **Tools:** GUI frameworks (e.g., PyQt, Tkinter for Python; React, Vue for JavaScript), parsing libraries for text input, code generation tools.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Defining a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) for application description.
*   [ ] Parsing text input based on the DSL.
*   [ ] Generating basic UI components (e.g., buttons, text fields) from parsed input.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing a drag-and-drop interface for UI design.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Generating executable code from the design.
