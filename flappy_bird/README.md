# Flappy Bird Game

This project implements the classic Flappy Bird game in a command-line interface.

## How to Play

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python flappy_bird.py
    ```
2.  The bird will automatically fall due to gravity. Pipes will appear from the right. The goal is to avoid hitting pipes or the ground.

## Features

-   **CLI-based Graphics:** Renders the game using text characters.
-   **Gravity and Flapping:** Simulates bird movement with gravity and a basic flap mechanism.
-   **Pipe Generation:** Generates pipes at regular intervals.
-   **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with pipes and the ground.
-   **Score Tracking:** Increments score when the bird successfully passes a pipe.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. For a fully interactive game, input handling for flapping would need to be added.
