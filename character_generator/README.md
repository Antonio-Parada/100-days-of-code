# Character Generator

This project implements a basic command-line character generator for fantasy role-playing games.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python character_generator.py
    ```
2.  The script will generate and display a random character. You will be prompted to generate another character or quit.

## Features

-   **Random Name Generation:** Combines random first and last names.
-   **Random Class and Race Selection:** Assigns a random class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric) and race (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Orc).
-   **Random Stat Generation:** Generates random values for core character statistics (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma).
-   **Character Sheet Display:** Presents the generated character's details in a readable format.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. More complex features like character backstories, equipment, or a graphical interface could be added.
