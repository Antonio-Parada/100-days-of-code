# Recipe Generator

This project implements a basic command-line recipe generator that creates random recipes based on predefined ingredients and cooking methods.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python recipe_generator.py
    ```
2.  The script will generate and display a random recipe. You will be prompted to generate another recipe or quit.

## Features

-   **Random Recipe Generation:** Combines various cuisines, main ingredients, cooking methods, spices, and sides to create unique recipes.
-   **Customizable Ingredients:** The lists of ingredients, methods, and cuisines can be easily extended.
-   **CLI Display:** Presents the generated recipe in a clear, readable format.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. More advanced features like ingredient compatibility checks, nutritional information, or web scraping for real recipes could be added.
