# Map Maker

This project implements a basic command-line map generator using Perlin noise for procedural generation.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python map_maker.py
    ```
2.  The script will generate and display a random map. You will be prompted to generate another map or quit.

## Features

-   **Procedural Generation:** Generates unique terrain maps using Perlin noise.
-   **Customizable Parameters:** Allows adjustment of scale, octaves, persistence, and lacunarity for varied map styles.
-   **CLI Visualization:** Renders the generated map using text characters representing different terrain types (water, land, forest, mountain).

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. More advanced features like specific biome generation, resource placement, or a graphical interface could be added.
