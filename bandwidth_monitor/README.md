# Bandwidth Monitor Project

## Description

This project aims to build a tool to track how much data is downloaded and uploaded to the internet. It should be able to provide weekly reports of usage and optionally notify the user when a specified usage limit is exceeded. A bonus challenge is to predict peak usage times.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (or any language with good networking libraries)
*   **Tools:** Libraries for network statistics (e.g., `psutil` for Python), email sending (e.g., `smtplib` for Python).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Basic network usage tracking (download/upload).
*   [ ] Data storage for historical usage.
*   [ ] Generating weekly usage reports.
*   [ ] Implementing usage limit notifications.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Predicting peak usage times.
