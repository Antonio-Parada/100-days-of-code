# Machine Translator Project

## Description

This project involves building an application to translate text from one language to another. For bonus points, it could include an image translator that can extract text from an image and then translate it.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for NLP and machine learning)
*   **Tools:** Hugging Face Transformers (for pre-trained models), NLTK, spaCy, Google Translate API (for integration).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Choosing a translation approach (rule-based, statistical, neural).
*   [ ] Implementing basic text translation (e.g., English to French).
*   [ ] Handling simple sentences.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Integrating with a translation API for more robust translation.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Image-to-text (OCR) integration for image translation.
