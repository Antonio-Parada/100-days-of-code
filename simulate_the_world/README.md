# Simulate the World

This project implements a basic command-line simulation of a world with autonomous agents.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python world_simulator.py
    ```
2.  The simulation will run automatically, showing agents moving randomly within the world. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the simulation.

## Features

-   **Autonomous Agents:** Multiple agents move randomly within the simulated world.
-   **CLI Visualization:** Renders the world and agents using text characters in the console.

## Notes

This is a basic simulation. Advanced features like agent interactions, environmental factors, or more complex behaviors are not yet implemented.
