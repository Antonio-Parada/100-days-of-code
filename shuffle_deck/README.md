# Shuffle Deck Project

## Description

This project involves building a web app to visualize different shuffling algorithms that can be used to shuffle a standard deck of cards. The focus is on demonstrating the mechanics of various shuffling techniques.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** JavaScript (for web visualization), Python (for algorithm implementation)
*   **Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend), D3.js or other visualization libraries.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Representing a deck of cards (e.g., array of objects).
*   [ ] Implementing basic shuffling algorithms (e.g., Fisher-Yates shuffle).
*   [ ] Visualizing the shuffling process on a web page.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing and visualizing multiple shuffling algorithms.
*   [ ] (Bonus) User controls for speed and step-by-step visualization.
