# Pathfinding Visualizer Project

## Description

This project involves making a visualizer for different pathfinding algorithms. It can be combined with a maze maker to generate and solve mazes, demonstrating how algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* find the shortest path.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Processing, JavaScript (for web visualization)
*   **Tools:** P5.js (JavaScript library for creative coding), HTML Canvas API.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Representing a grid or graph for pathfinding.
*   [ ] Implementing a basic pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search).
*   [ ] Visualizing the search process and the final path on a canvas.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing multiple pathfinding algorithms.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Maze generation functionality.
