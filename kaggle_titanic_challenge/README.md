# Kaggle Titanic Challenge

This project contains a basic implementation of a Titanic survival predictor for the Kaggle Titanic Challenge.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python titanic_survival_prediction.py
    ```
2.  The script will automatically evaluate a simplified dummy dataset and print the prediction for each passenger, along with the overall accuracy.

## Features

-   **Simplified Logistic Regression Model:** Uses a basic linear combination of features passed through a sigmoid function to predict survival probability.
-   **Dummy Dataset:** Includes a small, hardcoded dataset for demonstration and testing.
-   **Model Evaluation:** Calculates and displays the accuracy of the predictions on the dummy dataset.

## Notes

This is a highly simplified model for demonstration purposes. A real-world solution would involve:

-   **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
-   **Model Selection and Training:** Using more sophisticated machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) and training them on the full dataset.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters for best performance.
-   **Cross-validation:** Ensuring the model's robustness and generalization ability.
