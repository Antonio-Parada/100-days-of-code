# Relational Database Management System Project

## Description

This project involves building a basic relational database management system (RDBMS) from scratch. It doesn't have to be compatible with existing systems like MySQL or PostgreSQL, but it should help users manage their data efficiently and create relational tables.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for data structures and file handling), C++ (for performance-critical components)
*   **Tools:** File I/O, data parsing, custom data structures for tables and indices.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Defining basic table structure (columns, data types).
*   [ ] Creating tables.
*   [ ] Inserting data into tables.
*   [ ] Retrieving data from tables.
*   [ ] Basic querying (e.g., filtering by column value).
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing relationships between tables.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Basic indexing for faster lookups.
