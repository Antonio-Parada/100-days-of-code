# Project Euler Solutions

This project contains solutions to problems from Project Euler (projecteuler.net).

## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5

**Problem Statement:** If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**Solution:** The solution involves iterating through numbers below 1000 and checking if they are divisible by 3 or 5. If so, they are added to a running sum.
