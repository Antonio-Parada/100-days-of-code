# Flappy Bird AI

This project implements a basic AI for the classic Flappy Bird game in a command-line interface.

## How to Play

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python flappy_bird_ai.py
    ```
2.  The AI will automatically control the bird, attempting to navigate through pipes.

## Features

-   **CLI-based Graphics:** Renders the game board using text characters.
-   **Basic AI Logic:** The AI makes decisions to flap based on the bird's vertical position to avoid obstacles.
-   **Pipe Generation:** Generates pipes at regular intervals.
-   **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with pipes and the ground.
-   **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the AI's score.

## Notes

This AI is a simple rule-based system and may not be optimal. More advanced AI techniques (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning) could be used to create a more sophisticated player.
