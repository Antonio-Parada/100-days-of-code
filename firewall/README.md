# Firewall Project

## Description

This project involves building a firewall software that can regulate network connections for the user and block/notify of suspicious actions. This will require understanding network packets and system-level network interactions.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (with libraries for network interaction), C++ (for lower-level control)
*   **Tools:** `scapy` (Python for packet manipulation), `netfilterqueue` (Linux-specific for packet filtering), or platform-specific APIs for network filtering.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Understanding network packet structure and flow.
*   [ ] Basic packet capturing (similar to packet sniffer).
*   [ ] Implementing rules for blocking/allowing connections based on IP, port, or protocol.
*   [ ] Notification mechanism for suspicious activity.
*   [ ] (Bonus) User interface for managing rules.
