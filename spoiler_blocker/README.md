# Spoiler Blocker Project

## Description

This project involves building a browser extension that blocks movie spoilers on websites. This will require developing a smart algorithm to identify spoilers from a piece of text.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** JavaScript (for browser extension development)
*   **Tools:** Browser Extension APIs (Chrome, Firefox), Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for spoiler detection.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure for a browser extension.
*   [ ] Basic content script to read text from web pages.
*   [ ] Implementing a simple keyword-based spoiler detection algorithm.
*   [ ] Replacing or blurring spoiler text on the page.
*   [ ] (Bonus) More advanced NLP for context-aware spoiler detection.
*   [ ] (Bonus) User settings for customization.
