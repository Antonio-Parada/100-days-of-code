# Packet Sniffer Project

## Description

A packet sniffer is used to monitor network traffic by examining streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network. This project aims to implement an application that tracks network packets and parses their content into a human-readable form.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Java, C++ (or Python with libraries like Scapy)
*   **Tools:** Understanding of network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, etc.)

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Raw socket creation and packet capturing.
*   [ ] Parsing Ethernet headers.
*   [ ] Parsing IP headers.
*   [ ] Parsing TCP/UDP headers.
*   [ ] Displaying packet information in a human-readable format.
