# Version Control System Project

## Description

This project involves making a proper version control system like Git that can keep track of any changes made to a project. This will require understanding file system operations, hashing, and data structures for managing versions.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for ease of prototyping), C/C++ (for lower-level control and performance)
*   **Tools:** Hashing libraries (e.g., `hashlib`), file system manipulation (`os`, `shutil`), data structures (trees, graphs).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Initializing a repository.
*   [ ] Adding files to be tracked.
*   [ ] Committing changes (storing snapshots).
*   [ ] Viewing commit history.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Branching and merging.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Remote repository interaction.
