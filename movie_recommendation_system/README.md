# Movie Recommendation System Project

## Description

This project involves building a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The goal is to come up with a custom algorithm rather than copying an existing one.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Tools:** Pandas (for data manipulation), Scikit-learn (for collaborative filtering or content-based methods), MovieLens dataset (for testing).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Defining a simple representation of user movie preferences (e.g., ratings).
*   [ ] Implementing a basic recommendation algorithm (e.g., based on genre similarity or simple collaborative filtering).
*   [ ] Suggesting movies based on the algorithm.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Integrating with a movie database API (e.g., TMDb) to fetch real movie data.
*   [ ] (Bonus) User interface for movie rating and recommendations.
