# Chess Game

This project implements a basic command-line version of Chess.

## How to Play

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python chess_game.py
    ```
2.  The game will display the board. Enter the row and column for your starting piece, then the row and column for your destination.

## Features

-   **Board Representation:** Displays a standard 8x8 chessboard.
-   **Basic Move Validation:** Checks if a move is within board boundaries and if it's the current player's piece.
-   **Turn Management:** Alternates turns between white and black players.

## Notes

This is a simplified version of Chess. It does not include specific piece movement rules (e.g., how a knight moves), check/checkmate detection, castling, en passant, or pawn promotion. It serves as a foundational structure for a more complete Chess game.
