# Face Tracker Project

## Description

This project involves building a piece of software that will analyze pictures (or live cam feed) and tag faces in the images with a box. This will require using computer vision techniques.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Tools:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), pre-trained face detection models (e.g., Haar Cascades, DNN models).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Loading an image or capturing video from webcam.
*   [ ] Integrating with OpenCV for image processing.
*   [ ] Applying a face detection algorithm (e.g., Haar Cascade).
*   [ ] Drawing bounding boxes around detected faces.
*   [ ] Displaying the image/video with detected faces.
