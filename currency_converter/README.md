# Currency Converter

This project implements a basic command-line currency converter that converts amounts between different currencies based on predefined exchange rates.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python currency_converter.py
    ```
2.  Follow the prompts to enter the amount, the currency you want to convert from, and the currency you want to convert to.

## Features

-   **Currency Conversion:** Converts amounts between USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY.
-   **Predefined Exchange Rates:** Uses a simple dictionary for exchange rates (can be easily extended).
-   **Error Handling:** Provides feedback for invalid currency inputs.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. For a real-world application, you would need to integrate with a live exchange rate API and handle more complex currency pairs and edge cases.
