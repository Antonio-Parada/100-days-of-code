# Static Code Analyzer Project

## Description

This project involves making a software that will go through code (without executing it) and check for any inconsistencies or errors (syntax errors, indentation, etc.) that may cause problems during execution. This is a fundamental tool in software development.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for parsing and analysis), or any language you feel comfortable with.
*   **Tools:** Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) parsing libraries (e.g., `ast` module in Python), regular expressions, custom rule engines.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Reading code from a file.
*   [ ] Basic syntax checking (e.g., missing parentheses, unclosed quotes).
*   [ ] Checking for simple style inconsistencies (e.g., indentation, naming conventions).
*   [ ] Reporting identified issues with line numbers.
*   [ ] (Bonus) More advanced semantic analysis.
