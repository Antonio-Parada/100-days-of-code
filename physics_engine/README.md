# Simple 2D Physics Engine

This project implements a basic 2D physics engine that can simulate simple physical interactions like gravity and collisions.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python physics_engine.py
    ```
2.  The simulation will run automatically, showing a particle falling and bouncing within the defined boundaries.

## Features

-   **Particle Representation:** Defines particles with position, velocity, radius, and mass.
-   **Gravity:** Applies a constant gravitational force to particles.
-   **Basic Collision Detection:** Handles collisions with the boundaries of the simulation space, causing particles to bounce.
-   **CLI Visualization:** Renders the simulation using text characters in the console.

## Notes

This is a foundational physics engine. Advanced features like inter-particle collisions, different force types, and more complex shapes are not yet implemented.
