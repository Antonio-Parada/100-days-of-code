# Command Line Terminal Project

## Description

This project involves cloning a basic shell like Bash or Windows PowerShell as an independent project. This will deepen understanding of operating systems and command execution.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for cross-platform compatibility and ease of development), C/C++ (for lower-level control and performance)
*   **Tools:** `subprocess` module (Python), `os` module (Python), command parsing libraries.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Accepting user input for commands.
*   [ ] Parsing commands and arguments.
*   [ ] Executing external commands (e.g., `ls`, `dir`, `echo`).
*   [ ] Handling basic built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`).
*   [ ] (Bonus) Input/output redirection.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Command history.
