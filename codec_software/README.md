# Codec Software Project

## Description

This project involves building a software that will encrypt and decrypt text. The goal is to incorporate various algorithms to provide flexibility to the user.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** C, C++, Java, Python
*   **Tools:** Cryptography libraries (e.g., `cryptography` for Python), understanding of encryption algorithms (Caesar cipher, Vigenere cipher, AES, RSA).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Implementing a simple encryption algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher).
*   [ ] Implementing the corresponding decryption algorithm.
*   [ ] Command-line interface for text input and output.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing multiple encryption algorithms.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Handling file encryption/decryption.
