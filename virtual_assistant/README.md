# Virtual Assistant Project

## Description

This project involves building a virtual assistant that can help users carry out various tasks like calling people, scheduling tasks, creating todo lists, and taking notes. The assistant should be able to understand and respond to voice or text commands.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for core logic, NLP, and integrations)
*   **Tools:** Speech recognition libraries (e.g., `SpeechRecognition`), text-to-speech libraries (e.g., `gTTS`, `pyttsx3`), NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy), calendar/todo APIs.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Basic command recognition (text-based).
*   [ ] Implementing simple task management (add/view todo items).
*   [ ] Implementing note-taking functionality.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Speech-to-text input.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Text-to-speech output.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Integration with external services (e.g., calendar, weather).
