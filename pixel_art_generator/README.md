# Pixel Art Generator

This project implements a basic command-line pixel art generator that creates random pixel art patterns.

## How to Use

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python pixel_art_generator.py
    ```
2.  The script will generate and display a random pixel art. You will be prompted to generate another or quit.

## Features

-   **Random Art Generation:** Creates pixel art based on a random density of filled pixels.
-   **Customizable Dimensions:** The width and height of the art can be adjusted.
-   **CLI Visualization:** Renders the pixel art using block characters in the console.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. More advanced features like image conversion to pixel art, different pixel colors, or user drawing capabilities could be added.
