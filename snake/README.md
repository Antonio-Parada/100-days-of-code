# Snake Game

This project implements the classic Snake game in a command-line interface.

## How to Play

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```
2.  The snake will automatically move to the right. The goal is to eat the food ('F') to grow and increase your score. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself.

## Features

-   **CLI-based Graphics:** Renders the game board using text characters.
-   **Food Generation:** Randomly places food on the board.
-   **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
-   **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player's score.

## Notes

This is a basic implementation. For a fully interactive game, you would need to add input handling to control the snake's direction.
