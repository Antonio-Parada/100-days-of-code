# Sorting Visualizer Project

## Description

This project involves building a webpage or video that will visualize different sorting algorithms. Various visualizations can be used, such as dots, bars, color bars, or circularly scattered points.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** JavaScript (for web visualization), Processing (for desktop visualization)
*   **Tools:** HTML Canvas API (JavaScript), P5.js (JavaScript library for creative coding), or other visualization libraries.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Representing data to be sorted (e.g., an array of numbers).
*   [ ] Implementing a basic sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort).
*   [ ] Visualizing the sorting process step-by-step on a web page.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Implementing and visualizing multiple sorting algorithms.
*   [ ] (Bonus) User controls for speed and array size.
