# Build an OS Project

## Description

This project is technically challenging and aims to deepen understanding of how computers and operating systems work by building a simple OS from the ground up. This is a highly complex and long-term endeavor.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Low-level languages like C/C++ (for kernel and drivers), Assembly (for bootloader).
*   **Tools:** QEMU (for emulation), GRUB (for bootloader), cross-compilers (e.g., GCC).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Setting up a development environment (cross-compiler, emulator).
*   [ ] Writing a basic bootloader (e.g., in Assembly).
*   [ ] Implementing a minimal kernel (e.g., printing to screen).
*   [ ] (Bonus) Basic memory management.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Handling interrupts.
