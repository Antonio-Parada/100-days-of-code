# Tic Tac Toe AI

This project implements an AI opponent for the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Minimax algorithm.

## How to Play

1.  Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe_ai.py
    ```
2.  Follow the prompts to enter your moves (0-8) on the board. The AI will automatically make its moves.

## Features

-   **Unbeatable AI:** The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally, ensuring it will either win or tie the game.
-   **CLI-based Interface:** The game is played through the command-line interface.
-   **Win/Tie Detection:** Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.

## Notes

This implementation focuses on the core AI logic. A graphical interface could be added for a more user-friendly experience.
