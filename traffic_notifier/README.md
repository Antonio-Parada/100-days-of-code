# Traffic Notifier Project

## Description

This project involves building an app (preferably a phone app) that finds how congested one route is and then suggests a better route to take to a destination. This will require integrating with mapping and traffic data services.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Java/Kotlin (for Android), Swift (for iOS), Python (for backend/API interaction)
*   **Tools:** Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap API, or other traffic data providers. Mobile development frameworks (Android Studio, Xcode).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Choosing a mapping/traffic API and obtaining an API key.
*   [ ] Functionality to get traffic conditions for a given route.
*   [ ] Calculating alternative routes.
*   [ ] Displaying route information and traffic congestion.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Real-time traffic updates.
