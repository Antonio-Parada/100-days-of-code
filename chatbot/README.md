# Chatbot Project

## Description

This project involves building a chatbot that users can interact with. For bonus points, machine learning/AI can be incorporated to make it smarter. The initial implementation will be a simple CLI application.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (or any language suitable for CLI applications and text processing)
*   **Tools:** NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for basic NLP, or more advanced ML frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI features.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Basic rule-based response system.
*   [ ] Command-line interface for user interaction.
*   [ ] Simple pattern matching for responses.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Integration of a basic machine learning model for more dynamic responses.
