# Audio to Sign Language Translator Project

## Description

This project involves building a system that translates audio input into sign language. The sign language output can be in the form of a series of images or a video. This is a highly complex project requiring advanced NLP and computer graphics/animation.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for audio processing, NLP, and potentially animation)
*   **Tools:** Speech-to-text libraries (e.g., `SpeechRecognition`), NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy), animation/graphics libraries (e.g., `Pillow` for image sequences, `Blender` for 3D animation if integrated).

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Basic audio input processing.
*   [ ] Converting spoken words to text (speech-to-text).
*   [ ] Defining a simplified mapping of words/phrases to conceptual sign language representations.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Generating a sequence of images representing sign language gestures for simple words.
*   [ ] (Bonus) More advanced NLP for understanding context and nuances.
