# Math Editor Project

## Description

This project aims to build an application that properly formats mathematical equations from user input. The goal is to convert plain English text or a simplified syntax into well-formatted equations, similar to LaTeX.

## Suggested Language & Tools

*   **Language:** Python (for parsing and backend logic), JavaScript (for web frontend with rendering libraries)
*   **Tools:** Parsing libraries (e.g., `ply` for Python), MathJax/KaTeX (for rendering equations in web), or custom rendering logic.

## Progress

*   [ ] Initial setup and project structure.
*   [ ] Defining a simple syntax for mathematical expressions.
*   [ ] Parsing user input into an internal representation.
*   [ ] Converting internal representation to a displayable format (e.g., LaTeX string).
*   [ ] (Bonus) Basic GUI for input and display.
*   [ ] (Bonus) Support for more complex mathematical operations and symbols.
